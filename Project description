Project: Predicting House Prices

Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on various features.

Dataset:
You will be provided with a dataset containing information about houses, including features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, etc. The dataset also includes the corresponding sale prices of the houses.

Tasks:
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Explore the data to understand its structure, check for missing values, and perform any necessary data cleaning.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).
Preprocess the data by handling categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding) and scaling numerical features if necessary.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest) and train a model using the training data.
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).
Tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance (e.g., using cross-validation).
Test the final model using the testing data and assess its performance.
Optionally, visualize the predictions versus the actual prices to understand the model's behavior.
